		HW: 118/3:1:
			Well, this is certainly a multi-faceted question which brings up
			a lot of interesting advantages and drawbacks. Staying at an
			international chain hotel might sound relaxing and it certainly
			has its prestige, but you might not get relaxed when you check out
			and get the bill. Staying at a hostel might keep your costs lower,
			but the ultimate money-saver is just sleeping in a tent. Speaking
			of if you get your money's worth, a intl. chain hotel is luxurious,
			meanwhile a hostel might just have the bare necessesary facilities.
			And we shan't neglect the fact the tent has absolutely nothing.
			In terms of convenience, the intl. chain hotel is the most convenient.
			As in they are commonly in the city/town centre, and are absolutely
			packed with what people usually require. In a hostel you might have to
			walk, or take public transportation, to get to your destination. In my
			opinion, staying in a tent is usually the preferred method of
			adventurous people whom might be on a motorcycle trip and aren't able
			to stay at either of the other two options. At least whenever you're
			staying in a tent you're getting fresh air, and nature's beautiful
			scenery. In my opinion I'd rather stay at an inexpensive hostel than an
			intl. chain hotel and a tent would be my Plan B if it ever had to make
			this kind of descision.

		time, money

		In my opinion, it's hard to find time to keep fit.  One reason for
		this is people already have too many things to do.  Another reason
		might be that going to the gym, for example, costs money.  Let me
		give you an example: me.

      be themselves in thri natural habitat.
