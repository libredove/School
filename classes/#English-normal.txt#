			Hi Alex,
			
			Thanks for your email. I'm afraid I am unable to accept your
			invitation as I am just too busy with work, school, and with the
			driving practice.
			
			Do you fancy visiting my family instead? We have some traditions
			which you probably haven't heard of. The main tradition in Hungary
			when we celebrate Easter is the girls paint eggs in all kinds of
			different colours and the boys go and "water" them with perfume.
			
			What do you think? Would you like to come and visit us sometime? I
			look forward to your reply.
			
			Take care, GÃ¡bor

			1: This image shows two people using phones and tablets.
			The girl on the left looks stumped meanwhile the boy
			on the left looks surprised. Their emotions must be like
			this because of the things they've seen or read on their
			devices.
			2: Personally, I think I spend too much time on SNS sites
			but I only use some where I talk with my friends. We usually
			talk about normal people stuff but sometimes we talk about
			nerd stuff and also some philosophy.
			3: I think it's pretty important as I would've gone insane
			years ago.

9th lesson, 2025/09/18:
	StB: 20/1:
		1: Do you know of any local festivals in Hungary? What do they
		celebrate? What do people do?:
			I know of one certain festival in my town. It's about light and
			rave parties. We have three big cooling towers next to the old
			coal power plant in the industrial part of town and every year
			there's an enormous "light festival" there. There are two types of
			people who come to the festival. The artistic types whom only come
			to look at the lighting (different event), and the ones whom only
			come to get incredibly drunk and have fun at the rave party.
		2: Do you enjoy festivals? Why?/Why not?:
			I do not enjoy festivals as most in my area are in the town
			centre, where I live so I can hear literally everything when they
			blast the music out of their stupid hundreds of kilowatts
			amplifiers and speakers.

17-18th lesson, 2025/10/10:
	StB: 30/Speaking: 1 -> 2,3: Similarities and differences:
		1:
			These pictures show different homes. The first picture shows terraced 
			houses meanwhile the second picture shows blocks of flats in all kinds of
			different colours. The first similarity is that both are made to house
			people and families. The second similarity is that usually one family
			lives in each designated place (such as a house and a flat). The third
			similarity is that both picures show modern buildings. The first
			difference is that the blocks of flats are way more economically viable to
			build. The second difference is that the terraced houses are usually way
			more isolated from each other, so there isn't as much noise pollution as
			there is in a block of flats. The third difference is that the houses in
			the first picture are in the suburbs, which means that you need a car to
			live there, but blocks of flats are usually built inside cities and towns,
			and are closer to shops, markets, and the like.
		2:
			1:
				A flat is closer to most modern necessities, but a house is way cozier.
			2:
				iunno
			3:
				I'd prefer to live in a flat in a city's (or town's) centre.
		3:
			1:
				In my opinion, the most important thing to consider whenever you're
				choosing a place to live is the location.
			2:
				If the your new home isn't fully furnished, then moving all the
				furniture is certainly a hassle.

				1: In my opinion the most important school subjects for life are the
					ones which change the way students think, such as mathematics, history,
					and the like. Students should spend more time with these classes since
					it helps them in the long-term.
				2: School discipline tells a lot about a perticular student's attitude
					regarding studying and life in general. If one's school discipline is
					not up-to-standards, then they may be expelled or worse. It may also
					help or hinder other students' progress or them making any progress.
				3: In my opinion, the most important school tradition is the "ballagÃ¡s",
					which is a certain event where the classes which have finished their
					studies at their school, and they have a special ceremony.
				4: Well, in my case it didn't help me develop social skills at all, well
					not in a way which helps me connect with my "peers" or generation.
					Usually "normal" pupils can easily connect with each other, but
					bullying and social isolation run rampant in primary and secondary
					schools. So in a way it helps certain students to become indifferent
					to any outside interaction, meanwhile the ones whom are socially
					respected are on a slippery slope to become the worst people you've
					ever met.
				5: I am currently not planning to revise for the Hungarian matura exam.
					I may haphazardly change my mind in the last second and start cramming
					for the history and literature exams. The technique which works for me
					is physically being in class and listening. But I may obviously can
					not do that right before my exams.
				6: To be honest, I do not know which university courses and departments
					are the most popular here. But I do have a faint idea of what they
					might be. Usually STEM-related courses and departments have the most
					amount of applicants in a year. In my definition STEM includes
					healthcare et. al. But there are still many secondary school graduates
					whom are interested in art and music. There are also universities and
					conservatories which may be perfect for them. The popularity of STEM
					and healthcare courses and the like in Hungary are proportional to the
					amount of undergraduates leaving the country, since even with an EE or
					some other kind of engineering degree they may find a highly respected
					and well-paying job somewhere else in the EU.

		37/3:
			This picture shows a girl sitting on presumably her own bed and reading
			her notes. She has a pen in her hand so maybe she's underlining the
			important parts of her notes which may need more time for her to
			memorise those parts. Meanwhile the second picture shows a group of
			students outside their campus. They are seen revising for their exam.
			This way of revising for an exam is better in my opinion than the previous
			way of revising, since one may ask another to help them with it. The third
			picture shows a notebook, with certain words and the start of paragraphs
			highlighted. This way might help with associating words and colours and/or
			the structure of their notes. The latter two ways of revising are the ones
			which I would choose if I had to. Asking someone else while revising and
			highlighting the necessary pieces of text would definitely help the person
			revising.
